<h1 id="cpu-architecture">CPU Architecture</h1>
<h2 id="registers">Registers:</h2>
<p><strong>Program Counter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contains the address of the next instruction to be executed</li>
<li>Once the current instruction is read, immediately points to the next instruction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accumulator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Holds the input / output data currently being processed</li>
<li>Results from processes are temporarily held in the ACC before being transferred to memory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Memory Address Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stores <em>Address</em> pf the current memory location (data or instructions)</li>
<li>Output goes directly to the address bus (via the buffer to prevent continual dumping</li>
<li>Allows the CPU to communicate with the address bus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Memory Data Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stores the data / instructions fetched from memory before use by the processor.</li>
<li>Acts as a buffer between processor and memory unit</li>
<li>Allows the CPU to communicate with the data bus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current Instruction Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stores the current instruction to be executed after being fetched from memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="buses">Buses:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A common physical pathway</li>
<li>Shared by signals to and from several components of a computer</li>
<li>Consists of 3 parts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Address Bus, Data Bus, Control Bus</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Address Bus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carries memory location to read from or write to.</li>
<li>Components watch the address bus for an address that they recognize</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Bus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carries data between processor and memory</li>
<li>Components receive data from the data bus…</li>
<li>…Or they place new data onto the data bus to travel to the processor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Control Bus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carries control signals from control unit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fetch---decode---execute">Fetch - Decode - Execute</h2>
<p><strong>Fetch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PC (Program Counter) holds the address of the next instruction</li>
<li>Address copied into the MAR</li>
<li>Address contents copied to the MDR</li>
<li>Contents of the MDR copied to the CIR</li>
<li>Contents of the PC incremented</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CIR contents sent to the CU (<em>Control Unit</em>)</li>
<li>CU decodes the instruction:
<ul>
<li>Checks against set of instructions held in the ROM within the CPU (<em>Microcode</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CU checks the required data is present for current instruction in the MDR</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Execute:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction address copied from CIR to MAR</li>
<li>Data at current MAR adrress copied to the MDR</li>
<li>Instruction is executed:
<ul>
<li>Floating point unit; arithmetic unit; logic unit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return result to the L1 data cache</li>
<li>Result sent to RAM / other appropriate location</li>
</ul>
